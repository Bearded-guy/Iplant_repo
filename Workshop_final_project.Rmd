This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

New stuff:
Don't forget to install packages. Or call them up in the library.


```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("ggthemes")
install.packages("reshape2")
library("ggplot2")
library("reshape2")
library("ggthemes")
library("plyr")
DataIn <- read.delim("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

Here is an example of how to create a subset of data. 

```{r}
Countrys <- c("Afghanistan", "China", "United States")
sub.data <- subset(DataIn, country == Countrys[1] | country == Countrys[2] | country == Countrys[3])
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
